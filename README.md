# HackathonPaglu
This project is a voice-based appointment booking system developed to simplify and speed up the front-desk workflow in clinics. Instead of typing out patient details, the receptionist can speak the information, which is then converted to text using a Speech-to-Text API like Google Cloud or Web Speech API. The JavaScript frontend captures the voice input, extracts details such as the patient’s name, symptoms, and preferred doctor, and sends it to a Node.js backend. The data is stored in a database (MongoDB or MySQL) and instantly reflected on the doctor’s dashboard using real-time communication methods like Socket.IO. The system aims to reduce manual errors, save time, and make the clinic experience more efficient. In the future, it can be expanded to support multiple languages, offline models for rural areas, and even voice notes for doctors. Some challenges we faced include background noise affecting accuracy, different accents, and browser compatibility issues. This project was built by Ananya Banwanshi, Sipra Mishra, Sumit Singh, and Vipul Sahu.
